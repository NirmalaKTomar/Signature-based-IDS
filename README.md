# Signature based IDS for Autonomus vehicles

This project aims to analyze different machine learning algorithmic techniques to detect known attacks on vehicular networks and discusses the security threats
associated with intra-vehicle and external networks. This project presents a hybrid intrusion detection system for automotive networks that uses
different supervised approaches to classify intrusions using signature based strategy in order to identify known threats and thereby provides an analyzed
conclusive outcome scores.

**Evaluation metric**
The modelâ€™s feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency are evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, detection rates  and F1-scores.

**Result**
Highest detection rates are of BruteForce and bot attacks in stacking which consist of PortScan, BruteForce and bot attacks by decision tree And by  extreme gradient boosting  model bot attacks
